# Causal \xdag

* A causal \xdag is a \xdag: A graph with vertices representing variables, and directed edges between the vertices and contain no cycles.
* It represents the causal relationships between variables: If one variable $x$ causes another $y$, we write $x \to y$.
* The absence of an direct edge between $x$ and $y$ indicates no *direct* effect of $x$ on $y$.
* The absence of directed edg between variables is as or more informative than the presence of directed edge.
* A causal \xdag must have all relevant variables, all explanatory and outcome variables and *all their common causes*.

# Causal \xdag

* A causal \xdag contains three key structures:

  * Chains
  * Forks
  * Colliders
  
# Chains

* Chains encode causal chains.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \tikzstyle{every path} = [-latex,thick]
  \tikzstyle{every node} = [circle, fill=gray!30]
  \node (x) at (0, 0) {$x$};
  \node (z) at (1, 1) {$z$};
  \node (y) at (2, 0) {$y$};
  \draw (x) -- (z);
  \draw (z) -- (y); 
  \end{tikzpicture}
  
* Controlling for or blocking $z$ blocks the causal effect of $x$ on $y$.

# Forks

* Forks indicate confounders or spurious correlations.
  
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \tikzstyle{every path} = [-latex,thick]
  \tikzstyle{every node} = [circle, fill=gray!30]
  \node (x) at (0, 0) {$x$};
  \node (y) at (2, 0) {$y$};
  \node (z) at (1, 1) {$z$};
  \draw (z) -- (x);
  \draw (z) -- (y); 
  \end{tikzpicture}
  
* Controlling for or blocking $z$ deconfounds the spurious correlation between $x$ and $y$.
  
# Colliders
    
* Colliders encode *endogenous associations*.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \tikzstyle{every path} = [-latex,thick]
  \tikzstyle{every node} = [circle, fill=gray!30]
  \node (x) at (0, 1) {$x$};
  \node (z) at (1, 0) {$z$};
  \node (y) at (2, 1) {$y$};
  \draw (x) -- (z);
  \draw (y) -- (z); 
  \end{tikzpicture}
  
* Controlling for or blocking $z$ *creates* a spurious correlation between $x$ and $y$.

# d-separation

* Two variables $x$ and $y$ in a causal \xdag are d-separated by $z$ if they are conditionally independent, conditional on $z$. 
* We write this as follows:
$$
x \CI y \given z
$$
* If two variables are conditionally independent, they will have a partial correlation of zero.
* In general, we can have sets of variables being d-separated by set of other variables.
* Every causal \xdag leads to list of d-separations. 
* Each d-separation is a testable hypothesis.
* The minimal set of d-separations (i.e. from which all others are derived) is the *basis set*.

# d-separation: Alternative definitions

* Two variables $x$ and $y$ are d-separated given $z$ iff *each* path from $x$ to $y$ is d-separated by $z$.

* A path is d-separated by $z$ iff any of the following hold.

  * The path contains a chain $x \rightarrow z \rightarrow y$ or $x \leftarrow z \leftarrow y$.
  * The path contains a fork $x \leftarrow z \rightarrow y$.
  * The path contains a collider $x \rightarrow m \leftarrow y$, where $m$ is neither $z$ nor any of $m$'s dependents is $z$.

# d-separation: Alternative definitions

* The two variables $x$ and $y$ are d-connected if there is *any* active path between them, and are d-separated if *all* paths that connect them are inactive.

* A path between $x$ and $y$ is *blocked* by variable $z$ if any of the following hold:

  1. $x$ and $y$ are connected by a chain in which $z$ is a middle node.
  1. $x$ and $y$ are connected by a common cause, and $z$ is that common cause.
  1. $x$ and $y$ are connected by a common effect (*collider*), but $z$ is not that common effect, and $z$ is not one of the effects of the common effect.

# Deciding d-separation: Bayes ball

* We can decide if $x$ and $y$ are d-separated by $z$ as follows:

* Shade $z$ (or all nodes in $z$ if $z$ is a set).
* Place a "ball" in $x$, let it "bounce around" and see if it reaches $y$.
  1. The ball can pass through chain unless middle node is shaded.
  2. The ball can pass through a fork unless shaded in middle.
  3. The ball can *not* pass through collider unless middle node is shaded.
  
* If the ball can get from $x$ to $y$ then $x$ and $y$ are d-connected, otherwise they are d-separated.

# Deciding d-separation: The "moral" and disoriented graph

* Draw the ancestral graph consisting only of the relevant variables (e.g., $x$, $y$, $z$) and all of their *ancestors* (parents, parentsâ€™ parents, etc.)

* *Moralize* the ancestral graph by *marrying* the parents. For each pair of variables with a common child, draw an *undirected* edge between them. If a variable has more than two parents, draw lines between every pair of parents.
* *Disorient* the graph by replacing the directed edges with undirected edges.
* Delete the *givens* and their edges, i.e. erase the conditioning variables from the graph and erase all of their connections.
5. If the $x$ and $y$ variables are disconnected in this graph (no path between them), they are d-separated.
